This course is an introduction to linear algebra and its usage in computational applications and continuous probability. The study of linear equations, linear functions, and their representations pervades numerous fields of study. Students will learn and practice fundamental ideas of linear algebra and simultaneously be exposed to and work with real-world applications of these ideas. As the complementary course to COMS 3203, this course will continue emphasizing a rigorous approach to mathematics, which will serve as a foundation for future courses like computer graphics, machine learning, and robotics. The learning and usage of Python and libraries such as NumPy is an essential component of the course, as is the development of basic skills of computational programming.

## Course Objectives
- Identify and utilize properties of vectors and matrices to manipulate and operate on them.
- Perform fundamental matrix operations and understand their interpretation as systems of linear equations and  linear transformations.
- Identify and utilize properties of vector spaces, including bases, dimension, and orthogonality.
- Practice and solve elementary optimization problems, particularly in the context of least squares.
- Solve for and understand the interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in matrices.
- Perform decompositions of matrices and their representations, including eigenvalue and singular value decomposition.
- Formulate and solve problems in computer science applications, including 3D transformations, linear regression, Markov chains, and principal components analysis.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python for elementary programming tasks.
- Demonstrate proficiency in NumPy and related libraries for scientific computational tasks involving real data.
