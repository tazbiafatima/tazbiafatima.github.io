Hi, آداب and سلام! I am Tazbia Fatima, a Journalist and Computer Scientist.

As an Engineer and Computer Scientist, I primarily focus on engineering data tools and machine learning for journalistic vision and research projects. I've been dabbling with deep learning and understanding AI's role in the world. Still looking to find the best wa

As a Journalist, I primarily focus on data-integrated and computational stories, using my engineering skills to bolster the evidences and reporting. 
I absolutely enjoy the rush of interviewing people and forming the network map in my head of all the angles in a story.

For my Master's Project, I investigated the business and perils of immigration routes from India and the presence of niche community on YouTube, meshing the non-fiction narrative structure with data analysis as a representation of my two professional worlds.

From my time at Columbia, I've been keenly interested in research. These projects range from experimenting with new exploratory data visualizations, analyzing the color scheme of paintings at the MET to finding causations for extreme climate events and studying the misinformation landscape of media. 

I absolutely enjoy the project design and management process.  

## Background
My hometown is Hyderabad, India. I lived in the city of pearls all my life until I moved to New York, US in August 2021 to pursue the [Dual MS in Computer Science and Journalism](https://journalism.columbia.edu/journalism-computer-science) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu). 
I speak English and Urdu with native proficiency and can read Arabic.

When I'm not working, I could be found on a swing in the park (or a swing in my home in India), watching documentaries or reading long-form non-fiction. I love my nieces, baking and airports! In another life, I think I'd make a very fine personal shopper - to my friends and family and in this life, I hope to write non-fiction narrative books and maybe engineer a tool that helps humans on the side.
